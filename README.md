# roam – Easily traverse nested Python data structures

**roam** provides an API to more easily traverse nested data structures using standard Python syntax without pesky error-handling at each step.

There are three simple steps to use **roam**:

1. Wrap your data in a `Roamer` shim
2. Express the path or paths to traverse through your data with "dot" or "slice" notation, whichever you prefer
3. Get the result by *calling* the `Roamer` shim object like a function.

```python
# Example nested data: nested dicts and class with attributes
>>> import collections
>>> Point = collections.namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>> data = {"a": {"b": {"c": Point(100, 200)}}}

# 1. Wrap your data in a Roamer shim
>>> import roam
>>> roamer = roam.Roamer(data)

# 2. Express path to traverse
>>> step = roamer.a.b.c.x

# 3. Get result by calling the Roamer shim
>>> step()
100

# Put it all together slightly differently (read on for details)
>>> roam.r(data).a.b.c['y']()
200

```


## Installation

Install **roam** with pip:

```bash
$ pip install roam
``` 

**roam** works with Python versions 3.6 and later and has no dependencies.


## Basics

### `Roamer` shim

**roam** works by providing the `Roamer` class as a shim over your data objects, to intercepts Python operations and do some extra work to make it easier to traverse nested data.

Get a shim object over your data by calling `roam.Roamer(data)` or you can use the shorter `r` alias: `roam.r(data)`

### Traverse paths

You traverse your data within the **roam** shim by expressing the path (or paths) to follow in Python attribute (dot) or key/index (slice) syntax.

At each step you express in a path, **roam** returns a new `Roamer` shim that represents data at that point in the path and the steps taken up to there.

Because **roam** intercepts and interprets the path operations it can provide some nice features:

- use dot syntax whether the data item supports attribute or index lookups:

  ```python
  >>> roam.r({"key": "value"}).key()
  'value'

  ```

- use slice syntax if you prefer, **roam** makes dot or slice operations work regardless of the underlying objects:

  ```python
  >>> roam.r(Point(x=1, y=2))["x"]()
  1

  ```

- mix and match dot and slice to your heart's content:

  ```python
  >>> roam.r({"point": Point(x=1, y=2)}).point["y"]()
  2

  ```

- use slice syntax to traverse a path step that cannot be a valid Python attribute name:  

  ```python
  >>> roam.r({"no-dash-in-attrs": "thanks"})["no-dash-in-attrs"]()
  'thanks'

  ```

Generally it makes no difference whether you choose dot or slice syntax to traverse a path, but in cases where an attribute and a key have the same name the choice can matter. Because **roam** applies your chosen operation first, you can handle this situation by telling it what to do:

```python
# Data with ambiguous "items" name: keyword in dict, and dict method
>>> roamer = roam.r({"items": [1, 2, 3]})

# A dot lookup returns the dict method, which probably isn't what you want...
>>> roamer.items()
dict_items([('items', [1, 2, 3])])

# ...so use a slice lookup instead. Roam will then do a slice lookup first
>>> roamer["items"]()
[1, 2, 3]

```

### Get a result, or `MISSING`

You get a final result by *calling* the shim `Roamer` object like a function with `()` parentheses, to tell **roam** to return the underlying data from behind the shim.

If you expressed a valid path through your data you will get the result you expect.

If you expressed an **invalid** path, **roam** will *not* complain or raise an exception. Instead, it will return a `roam.MISSING` marker object to let you know that there is no data available at the path.

The `roam.MISSING` object is falsey in a number of ways, so you can either check for an invalid "missing" result directly or rely on its falsey behaviour:

```python
>>> roamer = roam.r(Point(x=1, y=2))

# Check for the `roam.MISSING` object directly
>>> roamer.z() is roam.MISSING
True

# Check indirectly via falsey behaviour
>>> bool(roamer.z())
False
>>> len(roamer.z())
0
>>> [i for i in roamer.z()]
[]

# The falsey MISSING object makes it easy to fall back to a default
>>> roamer.x() or "My fallback"
1
>>> roamer.z() or "My fallback"
'My fallback'

```

Of course, sometimes it's better to fail very clearly with an exception. Use the `_raise` argument to trigger a rich `RoamPathException` instead of returning a `roam.MISSING` object:
```python
>>> try:
...     roamer.x.y.z(_raise=True)
... except roam.RoamPathException as ex:
...     str(ex)
'<RoamPathException: missing step 2 .y for path <Point>.x.y.z at <int>>'

```

### Traverse collections

If your data includes collections of items such as a `list`, you can tell **roam** to iterate over the collection and apply following path lookups to **each item** in the collection instead of the collection as a whole.

You do this with a standard slice operation that *would return a collection* in standard Python usage. Use the special `[:]` slice to iterate over all items in the collection, or a subset slice using `[2:3]` etc to iterate over a subset.

When you traverse a collection with a slice operation, the final result is a `tuple` of data items.

For example:
```python
>>> roamer = roam.r({
...     "people": [
...         {"name": "Alice", "age": 34},
...         {"name": "Bob", "age": 42},
...         {"name": "Trudy"},  # Unknown age
...     ]
... })

# A `list` object does not have the attributee `name`
>>> roamer.people.name()
<Roam.MISSING>

# Use the "all items" [:] slice operation to iterate over each item
>>> roamer.people[:].name()
('Alice', 'Bob', 'Trudy')

# Get all but the last person names
>>> roamer.people[:-1].name()
('Alice', 'Bob')

```

**roam** handles collections differently from single items in the path in that it **ignores** items where the following path is invalid, filtering them out instead of returning `roam.MISSING` marker objects.

You can think of a collection traversal in **roam** as being like a combined *for-each* and *filter*.

```python
# Alice is 34, Bob is 42, Trudy has no "age" data
>>> roamer.people[:].age()
(34, 42)

```

When traversing a collection, if you use an integer index lookup instead of a slice **roam** will return the single n*th* item from the collection as you would expect:

```python
>>> roamer.people[-1].name()
'Trudy'

```

**WARNING**: **roam** has only *rudimentary* support for traversing nested collections. Simple cases should work, but if you need to traverse non-trivial collections data you should do the work with `for` loops in your code.

```python
>>> roamer = roam.r({
...     "people": [
...         {"name": "Alice", "pets": [
...             {"type": "cat", "name": "Mog"},
...             {"type": "dog", "name": "Spot"},
...         ]},
...         {"name": "Bob", "pets": [
...             {"type": "budgie", "name": "Bertie"},
...         ]},
...     ]
... })

# We can get the names of the "pets" collection under the people "collection"
>>> roamer.people[:].pets.name()
('Mog', 'Spot', 'Bertie')

# And look up just the n-th result at at a given level
>>> roamer.people[:].pets.name[0]()
'Mog'

```


## Advanced

**TODO**

- falsey-ness of `roam.MISSING`
- rich path descriptions and exceptions
- **roam** is a shim (lookup order, equality, iteration, falsey-ness, truthiness, length)
- call nested methods
- re-wrap result of nested method call with the `_roam` option
- fail fast with the `_raise` option
- call arbitrary functions with the `_invoke` option
